## What is Snowflake?
- Data warehouse runs on a Cloud Platform
- SaaS Product
- Cloud Agnostic solution
- It cannot be run on a private cloud, or on hosted infrastructures.
- It is primarily available on AWS, Azure and GCP cloud platform.  
- Snowflake is not a relational database. So, it doesn't enforce primary key and foreign key constraints.
- However, it offers Snowflake SQL commands like DDL, DML, and SQL functions. It also allows you to create UDFs and Stored Procedures using JavaScript/Python. Also it Supports all forms of ANSI SQLs including Analytical aggregations, Views and Materialized Views


## Why Snowflake?

Snowflake Architecture
    Separation of storage and compute recourses. In Snowflake, you will have a notion of two things.
		 1. Database
		 2. Virtual Warehouse
Data Sharing
Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
Time-Travel & Failsafe
Micro-partitioning
Zero-copy Cloning

#### Onboard/Offload Data into Snowflake
Stages 
  Internal Stage:(Load data directly from Local Machine)
  External Stage: ( Load data from Amazon S3, Azure Blob and GCP Bucket)
    Copy command

#### Snowflake Supporting File formats:
   Structured          : CSV
   Semi-Structured: JSON, AVRO, XML, ORC and Parquet

### Snowflake Functionalities
  Snowpipe
  Tasks and Stream

### AI/ML into Snowflake
Snowflake Cortex
	 Snowflake co-pilot
	 Document AI
	 Universal Search
Snowpark 

#### Ways to connect to Snowflake
1. Web UI (Snowsight)
2. ODBC/JDBC (DBeaver)
3. Command Line Utility (SnowSQL)
4. Python (Snowpark)
